Could habits reduce the effect of social influence on one's behavior? In 3 studies, we found that people with strong habits were less responsive to others' behavior. This pattern emerged for behaviors that are more desirable (water drinking, using a reusable water bottle instead of disposable cup) and less desirable (snacking while working). Habits could help explain why behavior sometimes does not respond to social influence. You can read the preprint here.
