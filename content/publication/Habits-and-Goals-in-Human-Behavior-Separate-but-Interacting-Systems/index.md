abstract: "People automatically repeat behaviors that were frequently rewarded in the past in a given context. Such repetition is commonly attributed to habit, or associations in memory between a context and a response. Once habits form, contexts directly activate the response in mind. An opposing view is that habitual behaviors depend on goals. However, we show that this view is challenged by the goal independence of habits across the fields of social and health psychology, behavioral neuroscience, animal learning, and computational modeling. It also is challenged by direct tests revealing that habits do not depend on implicit goals. Furthermore, we show that two features of habit memory—rapid activation of specific responses and resistance to change—explain the different conditions under which people act on habit or pursue goals Finally, we test these features with a novel secondary analysis of action-slip data. We find that habitual responses are activated regardless of goals, but can be performed in concert with goal pursuit."
