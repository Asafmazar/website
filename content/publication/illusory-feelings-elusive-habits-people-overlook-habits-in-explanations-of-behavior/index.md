abstract: "Habits underlie much of human behavior. However, people may prefer agentic accounts that overlook habits in favor
of inner states, such as mood. We tested this misattribution hypothesis in an online experiment of helping behavior
(N = 809 adults) as well as in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study of U.S. college students’ everyday
coffee drinking (N = 112). Both studies revealed a substantial gap between perceived and actual drivers of behavior:
Habit strength outperformed or matched inner states in predicting behavior, but participants’ explanations of their
behavior emphasized inner states. Participants continued to misattribute habits to inner states when incentivized for
accuracy and when explaining other people’s behavior. We discuss how this misperception could adversely influence
self-regulation."
