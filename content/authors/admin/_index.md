I'm a behavioral scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. I study how people form (and break) habits, as well as the impact of friction on behavior.

My work fuses a diverse range of methods, including field experiments, experience sampling, geospatial analysis, and surveys to understand how behavior change unfolds in real-world settings. My work has been published in top academic journals (_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Psychological Science_) and media outlets (_Washington Post, Forbes, CNN_). Before entering academia, I played harpsichord and jazz piano. You can read more about my work below or [email me!](#contact)

Over the years, I've had the fortune of knowing awesome people who helped me understand where I want to go and how to get there. I'm happy to pay it forward - feel free to [reach out to me](#contact) if you want to learn more about doing behavioral science within and outside of academia.
